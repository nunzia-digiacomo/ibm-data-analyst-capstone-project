# IBM Data Analyst Capstone Project

This repository contains my capstone project for the **IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate**, demonstrating end-to-end data analytics skills — from data collection and wrangling to visualization and dashboard creation.  

The goal of this project was to collect real-world data, clean and analyze it using Python and industry-standard tools, and present actionable insights through visualizations and an interactive dashboard.

## Project Overview

The project simulates a real-world data analysis scenario.  
It involves collecting job posting data related to data analyst positions and uncovering trends and insights across various technologies and skills.

Through this project, I applied the **data analysis workflow**:
1. **Data Collection** — Gathering data from APIs and web scraping sources  
2. **Data Wrangling** — Cleaning and normalizing raw data  
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** — Detecting trends, correlations, and outliers  
4. **Data Visualization** — Creating visual summaries of insights  
5. **Dashboard Creation** — Building a professional report for stakeholders
